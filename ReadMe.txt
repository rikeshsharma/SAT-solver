In this implementation we have used DPLL algorithm to implement SAT solver.
Test cases are present in "test" folder as cnf files.
Their corresponding outputs are "output" folder. If we have test.cnf test file then it's expected output is saved in test_out.txt file.
To execute this on, let's say, test.cnf file in test folder on terminal run the given command:
            > python3 ./SAT_solver.py test/test.cnf
